# pali-pi-sitelen-pona
break blocks and kill mobs to get sitelen pona, and craft using those sitelen pona!

For Dev:
The datapack will include many loot tables for all breakable blocks and mobs.
For example, when you break dirt, you will get the 'ma' sitelen pona
When you kill a chicken, you get 'waso' and 'nasa'
when you open a village chest, you get 'poki' 'pi' 'tomo' 'jan'
you can use the 'poki' sitelen pona to make a chest


sitelen pona font
The script that generates the loot tables needs:
The list of all blocks and entities in Minecraft
The toki pona translations with cartouches of all blocks and entities in Minecraft


Inspiration
Pheonix SC for the letter datapack
Minecraft for supporting components inside crafting recipes (huge!)
